# Decisions

Architectural decisions, oldest first. One entry per decision, appended in the session it was made.

## 2026-09-13 — Stack is Expo / React Native / TypeScript
Context: the owner has no Mac. Native iOS development would mean a GitHub Actions macOS runner round trip to see the result of every change, which makes iteration impractically slow. Builds are sideloaded onto his phone, never distributed.
Decision: Expo / React Native / TypeScript. Day-to-day development runs on his Linux machine with the app loaded on the phone over the network; macOS runners are needed only to produce signed builds.
Rejected: native Swift / SwiftUI, because every change would require a CI round trip and there is no local iOS toolchain. Flutter, because it adds a second language and buys nothing here.

## 2026-09-13 — Local-first storage, SQLite on device
Context: one user, one device, personal training and health data. The app has to work in a gym with no signal.
Decision: SQLite on the device is the system of record. Training and Nutrition data never leaves the phone. Tables are namespaced per module (training_*, nutrition_*, deals_*, finance_*) per the module contract in the spec.
Rejected: a hosted database or any sync layer, because it would force accounts, login and conflict resolution onto a single-user app. The Deals ingestion service is the one server-side exception and it holds no personal data, only vendor session tokens and a cache of public deals.

## 2026-09-13 — Repo is public, the spec stays out of it
Context: GitHub Actions macOS runner minutes are free for public repositories and expensive for private ones, and every build depends on those runners. The functional spec contains the owner's weight, body fat, sleep records, diet and other personal health details.
Decision: the repository is public. The spec file is listed in .gitignore, stays on the owner's machine only, and remains the source of truth locally. A PreToolUse hook blocks any attempt to write, stage or commit it, along with credential files and database dumps.
Rejected: a private repo, because the runner minutes would have to be paid for. Publishing a redacted spec, because a redaction maintained by hand eventually leaks something.

## 2026-09-13 — Finance is a module in this app, single user
Context: there is a separate specification for a personal finance app. Grocery spending is where the modules overlap: Finance knows what was actually spent, Nutrition knows the macros of what was logged, Deals knows what was on sale that week. Only one codebase can join those three. A free Apple ID also allows just three sideloaded apps.
Decision: Finance ships as a module inside this shell, under the same module contract as the others, and is single user like everything else here.
Rejected: a second standalone app, because protein per dollar against real spend becomes impossible to compute and a sideload slot is spent for nothing. Multi-user or shared finances, because that would force accounts, login and sync onto the entire platform to serve one module. Revisit as a scoped problem if it ever becomes real.

## 2026-09-13 — Attribution is stripped by a git hook, not by a setting
Context: CLAUDE.md forbids attribution of any kind in commit messages, PR titles and PR bodies. The attribution settings were already empty, yet a Claude-Session trailer still landed on all six setup commits. It is injected through the Bash tool description and does not honour those settings (known issue 77830). A setting that can be bypassed is not enforcement, which is the same reasoning that put the secret guard in a hook rather than in CLAUDE.md.
Decision: a commit-msg hook in .githooks/ strips any Claude-Session, Co-Authored-By: Claude or Generated with Claude Code line, along with the blank line it leaves behind, and core.hooksPath points at that directory. The attribution settings stay empty in the repo as a first line of defence. The six existing commits were rewritten to remove the trailer. PR bodies and titles go through the GitHub API rather than git, so no hook can reach them; CLAUDE.md now requires checking every PR body by hand before it is opened.
Rejected: trusting the attribution settings alone, because they were already set correctly and the trailer appeared anyway. Stripping the trailer by hand on each commit, because it depends on remembering. A pre-commit hook instead of commit-msg, because pre-commit cannot see or edit the message.

## 2026-09-13 — One PR is one commit on main, via squash merge
Context: the owner does not want the repository inflating his GitHub contribution graph. That graph counts commits on the default branch, so the nine granular setup commits registered as nine contributions on one day. Granular local commits are still wanted while working, because they are what makes a change reviewable and revertable.
Decision: work happens on a branch and lands on main through a GitHub squash merge, so one PR is exactly one commit. Local commits stay small and are never pre-squashed by hand. The nine setup commits already pushed were collapsed into a single root commit and force pushed, since that history was only ever local to this machine and nobody had pulled it.
Rejected: committing straight to main, which is what produced the problem. Rebase or merge commits on merge, because both carry every individual commit onto main. Writing fewer, larger local commits, because that trades reviewability for a cosmetic count.
